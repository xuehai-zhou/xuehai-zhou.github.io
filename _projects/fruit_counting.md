title: Occlusion-resilient fruit counting
description: Accurate yield estimation is critical for supply chain management. Traditional fruit detection methods, especially those using stitched images, often fail to address leaf occlusion problems. This project utilizes lightweight object detection neural networks and real-time tracking algorithms to count fruits in video footage, enabling multi-angle observation that significantly reduces occlusion issues. Furthermore, this method can be extended to incorporate features such as disease detection. Deploying this technology with an RGB camera on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or ground vehicles (UGVs) significantly enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural surveillance and management.

To enable real-time counting functionality in video streams, we initially train object detection neural networks, such as [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), enhanced with modules like [Swin-Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer) and [CBAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06521). Subsequently, [tracking techniques](https://paperswithcode.com/task/multi-object-tracking) are employed to eliminate duplicates of identical targets across consecutive frames. We have developed a customized module named MultiMap that assigns Track IDs to counting numbers, which are then displayed adjacent to the tracked objects in the video.

To accurately count objects in real-time video streams, we first detect bounding boxes and associate identical objects across frames using tracking algorithms like [DeepSORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort), [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack), and [StrongSORT](https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT). However, directly applying these tracking methods to counting tasks can lead to inaccuracies due to issues like ID jumpsâ€”where Track IDs are assigned before an object's presence is confirmed, causing discontinuities and overcounting. To solve this, we introduce the MultiMap scheme. MultiMap focuses on confirmed tracks, mapping each one to a unique counting number only after verification. It maintains a reference that records all confirmed tracks and assigns counting numbers based on object classes. This approach ensures accurate counting by effectively filtering out false positives and addressing ID jumps. By concentrating on confirmed tracks and providing a clear mapping to counting numbers, MultiMap offers a simple yet robust solution for counting tasks in large-scale applications.
