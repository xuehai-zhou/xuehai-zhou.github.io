I am Xuehai Zhou, a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Bioresource Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioeng/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), under the guidance of [Prof. Shangpeng Sun](https://shangpenglab.github.io/#/). Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my M.S. in Bioresource Engineering at McGill University in 2024, also mentored by Prof. Sun. I completed my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://scds.uoregon.edu/cs) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/) in 2021.

My research primarily focuses on [AI4Science](https://mila.quebec/en/research/strategic-priorities/ai4science) to advance [sustainable development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). I utilize techniques in 3D computer vision, radiometric imaging, and sensor fusion to investigate [plant phenotyping](https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/) and explore [plant-soil interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123847195001799), which are critical for effective crop breeding. My current research seeks to integrate genomics, phenomics, and environmental interactions within plant [root system architecture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123808684000028), enhancing our fundamental understanding of plant adaptation to changing environments and accelerating breeding processes.

I am keen on expanding my collaborative network, particularly with individuals who have expertise in [Computed Tomography (CT)](https://www.mcgill.ca/ecp3/multi-scale-imaging/equipment/macro-ct-scanner) data processing and [Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/quantitative-trait-locus-qtl-analysis-53904/) analysis. If you are interested in my research or potential collaboration, please [email me](mailto:xuehai.zhou@mail.mcgill.ca).
